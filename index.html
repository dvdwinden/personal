         Hey, hi ðŸ‘‹<br />
         <br />
         I'm DaniÃ«l. I like to <del>make the world a better place by creating digital solutions that improve peoples' lives and solve problems they encounter on a daily basis</del> create nice apps and websites.<br />
         <br />
         As a <del>neurosurgeon</del> digital designer I <del>strive to constantly explore how emerging, amazing technologies can help make our lives a little more exciting</del> try to keep things simple.<br />
         <br />
         I work at <a href="http://bakkenbaeck.com" title="Bakken &amp; BÃ¦ck">Bakken &amp; BÃ¦ck</a>. Here, I design things for large companies and small startups. I run our <a href="http://bakkenbaeck.amsterdam" title="Look at our office">Amsterdam office</a>, which means I try to make sure everyone has a place to sit, a bite to eat and enjoys the time they spend here every week. Now and then I meet people to see if we'd be able to work with them (<a href="mailto:daniel@bakkenbaeck.no" title="hihi email me">e-mail me ðŸ˜‰</a>).<br />
         <br />
         I enjoy writing. I've written a few of our company's blog posts in the past year (1, 2, 3) because I wanted to get better at that. Writing is quite similar to design, and the buzz you get from making a paragraph work after a couple of <del>fries</del> tries is ðŸ‘Œ<br />
         <br />
         <strong>A few design-related things I did in the past year or so:</strong><br />
         &mdash; Helped <a href="http://getexponent.com" title="Exponent">Exponent</a> shape their platform. Baby steps;<br />
         &mdash; Designed an iOS, Android and web app for <a href="http://meshnorway.com" title="Mesh">Mesh</a>, a large Scandinavian co-working space;<br />
         &mdash; Created a first version of <a href="http://openvote.com" title="Openvote">Openvote</a>, who are trying to make politics great again;<br />
         &mdash; Teamed with <a href="http://coinbase.com" title="Coinbase">Coinbase</a> to create a <del>super secret</del> secret product;<br />
         &mdash; Designed the <a href="http://wake.com" title="Wake">Wake</a> marketing website;<br />
         &mdash; Sketched out a first version of a Wake Apple TV app;<br />
         &mdash; Made an app that allows you to rent products from neighbours;<br />
         &mdash; Helped design a first take on a <a href="http://getkahoot.com" title="Kahoot!">Kahoot!</a> iOS app.<br />
         <br />
         Other than that, I (try to) host <a href="http://makersclubams.com" title="Makers Club: Amsterdam">Makers Club in Amsterdam</a> on a regular basis. Feel free to drop by one day.<br />
         <br />
         I try to eat healthy, stay away from Twatter more than I used to and hope to read 25 books this year. I'm terrible with my hands unless they touch a keyboard. Just recently I hung a coat rack in our office and drilled a hole <em>through</em> the wall. Oh man.<br />
         <br />
