         Hey, hi ðŸ‘‹<br />
         <br />
         I'm DaniÃ«l. I like to <del>make the world a better place by creating digital solutions that improve peoples' lives and solve problems they encounter on a daily basis</del> create nice apps and websites.<br />
         <br />
         As a digital designer I <del>strive to constantly explore how emerging, amazing technologies can help make our lives a little more exciting</del> try to keep things simple.<br />
         <br />
         I work at <a href="http://bakkenbaeck.com" title="Bakken &amp; BÃ¦ck">Bakken &amp; BÃ¦ck</a>. Here, I design things for large companies and small startups. I run our <a href="http://bakkenbaeck.amsterdam" title="Look at our office">Amsterdam office</a>, which means I try to make sure everyone has a place to sit, a bite to eat and enjoys the time they spend here every week.<br />
         <br />
         I enjoy writing. I've written a few of our company's blog posts in the past year because I wanted to get better at that. Writing is quite similar to design, and the buzz you get from making a paragraph work after a couple of <del>fries</del> tries is ðŸ‘Œ<br />
         <br />
         A few design-related things I did at B&amp;B in the past year or so:<br />
         <br />
         &mdash; Helped Exponent shape their platform. Baby steps;<br />
         &mdash; Designed an iOS, Android and web app for Mesh, a large Scandinavian co-working space;<br />
         &mdash; Created a first version of Openvote, who are trying to make politics great again;<br />
         &mdash; Teamed with Coinbase to create a <del>super secret</del> secret product;<br />
         &mdash; Designed the Wake marketing website;<br />
         &mdash; Sketched out a first version of a Wake Apple TV app;<br />
         &mdash; Made an app that allows you to rent products from neighbours;<br />
         &mdash; Helped design a first take on a Kahoot! iOS app<br />
         <br />
